#App description

This app lets a user input their custom settings for their pour over setup including the type of brewer 
being used, the roast type, the ratio of coffee to water, the amount of coffee, and the number of pours used.
This app, assumes the user has the necessary tools for a pour over brew, including a drip brewer of some kind and
a scale that measures in grams.

After the settings are initiated, the app automatically calculates the amount of water that will be needed
for each pour and the timer will then be ready to aid the user in their brew.

Once the timer is started, the user should manually press the 'next pour' button when they will begin a pour. 
The prompt indicates to the user up to how many grams of water should be up to by the end of each pour. 

When the last pour is stopped, the program displays the final brew time and the user then has the option to save
the current brew settings to their profile (if signed in). In the settings section, the settings for each brew is
displayed and gives the user the option to use the same settings for a new brew, or delete an unwanted setting.
